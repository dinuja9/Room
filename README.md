Its an online file sharing web app. Its like google drive but better and has more storage than it too, for cheaper (yet to be implemented).

As of sept 7th 2023: basics look of the landing page is done, and the sign in pop-up ui is complete. 

None of the interactivity has yet to be started:
  - Connecting OAuth for facebook, google and github
  - A log in page for current users
  - Gonna need to mess with AWS for storing files and user information, so databases...
